For my project, I created a NBA fantasy draft simulator. The user selects a team, that team is then randomly assigned a pick in the draft. Then, the program will loop through every team, and draft players to that team (including the user team) for five rounds. The program decides which player to draft by assigning each position a number, randomly generating a number between 1 and 5 (the number of positions), and then having the team select the highest ranked available player from that position. However, since there are only five rounds, and five positions to be filled, the program checks to make sure that each time, the team is drafting a player from position that they have not drafted yet. I have included the top 50 players from each position. After the draft occurs, the user can check the results by viewing their own team or they can choose another team they would like to see.
